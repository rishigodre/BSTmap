# BSTmap
After studying Binary Search Tree in my data structures and algorithm course I was motivaited to make a map like data structure in C++ that feels and works mostly!! like a normal map data structure
This map has a limitation as it is not balanced hence it has a tendency of geting skewed and hence the time complixity of search of not really O(N) 
Supports insert and clear operations 
Does not support individual node deletion and tree balancing
Learned operator overloading, lambda functions, and OOPs through this project

Open to suggestions and reviews
